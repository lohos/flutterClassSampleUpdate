Dr. Angela Yu's teaching is excellentâ€”thorough and step-by-step. Recently, I revisited her course due to work requirements. 
Given that most frameworks have been updated, it can be quite challenging for those who are not experienced in programming. Therefore, I have consolidated all the examples from the course into a single project. You only need to unMark the main.dart file to use it. (Note: For the Firebase section, please follow the course instructions and place the .json file in the corresponding location.)
